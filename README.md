# Wordle Solver

## Context and Motivation
After reading about the recent acquisition over the popular online game Wordle, I had to give the game a go. After a few days of playing on the New York Times website, I started to become curious if a program could beat (I mean help) the average human that plays the game. This thought process has led to this project.

## Additional Information
This solver only works on the [New York Times Wordle Website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) as solution array was taken from the source code, located in [source-code-arrays.js](./src/source-code-arrays.js).

## How to install and run the project

After cloning the repository and changing directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
